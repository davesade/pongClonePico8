Pong Clone Pico8
================
Written during live stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/482786687) (or see backup on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT81-cMCJpQ&list=PLLkqoegvtaAfngkEZ2KvFc8S7JxmGuAAT)) - this was not only to glorify one of most important titles in gaming history, but also to demonstrate easiness of PICO-8 engine to encourage to write more games for it.  
The game is far from perfect, but already playable via [GitHubPages](https://davesade.github.io/pongClonePico8/).  
**Controls:** Player 1 on the left side uses cursor keys. Player 2 on right side uses E and D keys.  
There is no real end of the match, score can be updated indefinitely.  
Enjoy!  

P.S.: Ralph Baer did it before Allan Alcorn!  
P.S.: Do not also forget to check [Tennis for two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_for_Two) from 1958!
